***This is a work in progress. I'm focusing most of my energies on these topics, so I'm adding/deleting stuff to this repo quite frequently. Even the repo's structure is not finished yet and probably it'll never be.***
## Basic concepts
In this section, I put resources that fall under a broader spectrum, so they're not verticalized into blockchain but they're somewhat related to them or viceversa.
